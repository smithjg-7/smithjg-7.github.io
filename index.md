### The Game

Invaders travel sideways and each time they touch the side, they will drop down a line.

There is no time limit, but if you do not shoot all of the invaders before they reach the bottom of the screen, the game will end.

As the player shoots more invaders, the remaining invaders move faster.

#### Troubleshooting

In order to extract the file, you will need to have WinRAR.

If the program fails, you probably need to update your Java installation.
